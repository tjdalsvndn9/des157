            How will your users understand the content of the project?
         </h1>
         <h3>
           My Korean pop content would be really straightforward. Therefore, it will be so easy to understand the content of my website. Moreover, I am going to
           make it as simple as possible to prevent users to be overwhelmed. 
         </h3> 
          <h1>  
          How will your users understand the primary objectives?
          </h1>
          <h3>
            I am going to use a lot of photos since Korean pop is not really familiar with American users. By adding photos and youtube videos, I can make the content to be more tempting and approachable. Users will think that this website is about music from South Korea. Even though users do not know South Koera, everyone knows what youtube video is and the purpose, listening to music, of Youtube video.
          </h3>
          <h1>
    What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?
    </h1>
    <h3>
    I am going to add optimized png or jpeg and either youtube videos or mp4 to make my website more interactive and fun.
    </h3>
    <h1>
    How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are â€¨their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?
    </h1>
    <h3>
      I am going to use Greensock Js and if I am not mistaken, SVG and vetor images are super popular since 2016. Therefore, nobody will get confused or get lost on my website. Moreover, Youtube videos are really simple to play.
