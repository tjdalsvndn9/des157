       <h3> I tested 2 different individual to see how they navigate my website. I first showed them typical K-pop drama and info archive websites. All of them told me that they are overwhelemed and do not know what to do. Then, I showed my website that I created. It does not have any banner, footer, or navigation top. However, it guides users to learned that Korean pop is as valuable as other cultures musics. The good thing was that both of testees told me that they like the website and it is really user interactive. I learned that I still have to work on responsive design and how to come up with engaging content to make users to start loving Korean pop</h3>
