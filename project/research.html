       <h3>I researched some big online platform website such as Udemy, Udacity and Quizzlet. One of the most interesting features they has is that all of these online learing platform websites have clean and Google material design UI in order to increase user traffic. Moreover, they used easy and crystal clear sentecnes to lower any confusions which might happen. I thought these strategies will increase marketing value of these companies and a lot of users will keep using their interface and platform to learn new stuff. Even though these websites are hugh, loading time was relatively short. I look into their front-end code and realized thet all of these websites used modern framework to build a single page application. A few years ago, a lot of developers used Wordpress in order to build a quick and overally well running website. However, Wordpress is extremely slow and it just looks like Wordpress website. In 2017, a lot of front-end developers use either Angular JS or React JS to make everything super fast and optimzed.
