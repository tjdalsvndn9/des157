       <h3>As I planned last time, I determined to build an online learning platform such as Quizlet, UDEMY. It is not going to be as fancy as UDEMY, but I really want to make an online school for everyone.
There are a few features that the most popular online learning platforms have. To build a successful learning platform, I need to make a discussion page and chat rooms for students and teachers. Many of crap learning platforms did not have these two features and students and teachers could not interact to discuss questions. Group pages and Grade book will be new features that I am going to implement since these two features are important to motivate students to keep up with their works.
As a design student, an appearance of the website is as important as its functions. Therefore, I get into some design research to find out what design is tempting to students. Then, I realized that most of websites used blue and white color to give a sense of trust and relief. Since I am a front-end developer and do not know how to hook up all my functions with data from back-end. Therefore, I have to work with a back-end developer who can help me out. Other than this, everything will be pretty cheap since everything is open source. 
Lastly, I am going to use Skype API to implement skype call on my website, so students can have a lecture with teachers.
