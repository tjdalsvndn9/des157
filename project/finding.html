         I have researched about 20 k-pop promoting websites and realized that the most of websites have not been updated and look like something built in 2007. Moreover, I saw a lot of material design and IOS design are used repetitively for no reason. I decided to keep my website simple and stick to just one purpose I proposed in the beginning. 
         I have conducted an interview and figured out that current k-pop webistes are too overwhelming and have too much info on main pages. Therefore, users could not decide what to do and those websites lose customer traffic.
