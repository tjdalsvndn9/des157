       <h3>I had really hard time to figure out what topic I am going for. I had so much on my mind, but was not able to pick one to demonstrate on a website. Then, I decided to introduce K-pop to the wolrd sine it is awesome and has been popular for 10 years. I am going to use D3.js, SVG, Greensock.js , Bootstrap, React.js and Vue Js to make my website a single application website. I am going to maximize its visual by using Greensock.js. Greensock js makes a website to be able to make SVG alive on a website. I am going to add introudction/ music video/ lifestyle / demo videos of selected k-pop stars. It is going to be a challenge for me to use new javascript libraries, but I will achieve it since I am awesome.
