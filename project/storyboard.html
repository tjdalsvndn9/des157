           I paired up with one of our classmates and found 3 similar K-Pop website to share with her.
           I wrote down the main 3 things to be accomplished by letting her test out the websites.
           I would like to know wheather or not users prefer a lot of information or minimal info on a website.
           I would love to know what colors users prefer.
         </h3>

          <h3>
            I believe the most of my website users would visit my website to get new information regarding Korean pop stars
            and Korean entertainment. I say the age range of users will be 10-30. Since everyone alreadys knows material design
            of news interface, I would just follow those trends to eliminate a possibility of users getting confused.
            I draw a usability test chart after observing the classmate. It seems like she goes to top navigation to search and 
            get used to the website. 
          </h3>
          <h1>
          Satisfaction
    </h1>
    <h3>
        I will upload a lot of videos and news to make my website tempting. 
        People would easily get inforamtion by clicking or searching any info regarding their interest.
        I have to download a lot of Korean pop star videos and upload on the webiste.
